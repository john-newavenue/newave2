<% provide(:title, 'How We Work With You') %>
   
<h1><%= yield(:title) %></h1>
<p>Traditionally, homeowners try to screen and hire architects and builders and manage their entire project, but this process remains complicated and stressful and is full of hidden tricks or surprises that can increase your costs way above your original goal.  Even the smallest projects can have 45 or more service professionals involved, coordinating or not coordinating, and homeowners are often left worrying or wondering if they’ve made all the necessary decisions and considerations for their project. It is a lot to manage, and it’s nearly impossible to keep a project on budget if you aren’t a professional project manager or don’t have the time, know-how and patience to oversee the project.  Most of our projects are completed within 5% of the bid. Increases and decreases are typically observed when you want to add something nice or change your mind on something during the construction process.</p>

<h2>Collaborative Platform and Marketplace</h2>
<p>Any of the architects or builders that you meet through New Avenue are long-term partners of our firm. They have committed to meeting our standards of service and quality. New Avenue works consistently and collaboratively with the same small firms, and these firms are motivated to continue working with us as opposed to just maximizing their profit from your job.  </p>

<h2>Integrated Project Delivery in 5 Structured Phases</h2>
<p>We break each project down to five manageable components.  You can hire us for any portion of this process or hire us to take you from concept to moving in.</p>
